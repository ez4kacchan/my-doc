You can call me HÆ°ng. I was born and raised in Vietnam. Still under 20, with a long journey ahead. I'm willing to learn anything from anyone if it helps me grow.

The sole purpose of this site is to document my life, how I face challenges, so that when I'm older, I can look back and be proud.

## Tech Stack

This page is built from AstroPaper template, which is written in vanilla JavaScript (+ TypeScript for type checking) and a little bit of ReactJS for some interactions. TailwindCSS is used for styling; and Markdown is used for blog contents.
